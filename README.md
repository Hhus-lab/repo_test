# Wolf Denning and Reproductive Success Analysis

This Rust project analyzes denning phenology and reproductive success in wolves 
using environmental and biological data. The project performs CSV parsing, data 
visualization, and graph-based analysis to uncover patterns and correlations in 
wolf ecology, particularly around the timing of denning and environmental factors 
like temperature and snow cover.

## ðŸ§ª Features

- **CSV Parsing**: Reads and processes wolf denning and reproductive data.
- **Graph Construction**: Builds graphs based on data similarities for network 
analysis.
- **Centrality & Clustering**: Identifies key data points and clusters based on 
phenological and environmental traits.
- **Plotting**: Generates line charts and scatter plots to visualize trends and 
correlations.

## ðŸ“Š Goals

1. Explore phenological patterns in wolf denning dates across multiple years.
2. Correlate reproductive success with environmental variables (e.g., snow cover, 
temperature).
3. Identify central or influential nodes in the network of reproductive data.
4. Cluster similar denning behavior to reveal population-level strategies.
